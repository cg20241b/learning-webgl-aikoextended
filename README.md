### Assignment 1
First I asked for my boyfriend's code as a base, where there was only a canvas and 3 letters of his name with gl.lines. Then I replaced it by using 3 letters of my name with the help of github copilot. After the first instruction was complete, then I asked chatGPT to create the gl.triangles but the letters P and U were still wrong, so I made them manually by estimating the coordinates. Finally, I made an animation that changes every 3 seconds with the help of chatGPT.
